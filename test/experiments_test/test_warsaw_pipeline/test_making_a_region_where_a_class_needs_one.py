"""
Giving a region-rooted class the region it takes, built from the body it was answered
about -- where the run was told to.

A reconstruction gives every object a body, so a class rooted on a region instead has
nowhere to stand and is refused. That refusal is not free: a window in a wall is the
commonest part-whole relation an interior has, and every one of them was being dropped
at the last step. A region the size and pose of the measured body is what bridges the
two, and it costs no geometry to try, because the cut is the mount's business and
happens only where the ontology says the relation removes it.
