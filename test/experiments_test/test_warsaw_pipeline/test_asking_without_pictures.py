"""
Asking a run's questions from the text alone, without rendering anything.

Rendering is most of what a run spends its time on -- 44 minutes of room 13's 55 -- and
three pictures per label is most of what it spends its money on. A run told to show no
pictures renders none, and the two questions that would have carried them say so rather
than describing pictures that are not there.

The label is still given. What is being measured is what the pictures add on top of it,
so everything else about the run stays as it was.
