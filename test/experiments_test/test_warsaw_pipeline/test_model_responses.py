"""
Reading an answer out of a reply that was written by a model rather than by a schema.

A model asked for JSON answers with it fenced, with a sentence in front of it, with the
array alone where an object was asked for, and sometimes with nothing at all. What is
checked here is which of those still carry an answer and which are refusals, because a
refusal read as an answer is a body that quietly gets no class.
