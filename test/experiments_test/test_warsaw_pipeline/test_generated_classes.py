"""
Building the classes a scene needs that the ontology does not have.

Two steps proposed compositions and only one of them was asked to. The vocabulary step
answers what a *label* means and names the mixins to compose it from, having been shown
what objects of that label were measured to meet; the classification step answers which
class each *object* is, from a picture, and its schema carries a superclass as well.
Read from the classification alone, a Faucet the vocabulary had composed with HasHandle
comes out with no way to hold a handle, and the pairing measured for it cannot be
mounted.
