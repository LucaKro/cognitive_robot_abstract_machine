"""
How a record reaches a file and comes back, now that krrood does the writing.

A record is written by naming its class in the file and letting the dataclass say what
its fields are. Three things about that are easy to lose and are pinned here: a record
read from a model's reply carries no class name, a tuple must not come back a list, and
a member of a string enumeration must come back the member.
