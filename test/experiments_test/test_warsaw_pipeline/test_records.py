The shapes one step of the pipeline hands to the next.

A step writes a file and the step after it reads it, so the two only agree because one
declaration serves both. What is checked here is that the declaration still reads
everything a real run wrote, and writes back exactly what it read: a field quietly
dropped in the reading is a decision quietly dropped from the run.
