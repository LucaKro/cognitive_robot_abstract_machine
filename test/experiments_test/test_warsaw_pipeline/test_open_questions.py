"""
Working out how few questions a scene's overlaps actually need.

Two hundred overlapping pairs are not two hundred questions. A face belongs to one
object, so ownership is asked once per set of claimants; a set whose every internal pair
the ontology settled is not a question at all; and what is left repeats, so it is asked
once per pattern of classes. Membership is asked only where a part meets more than one
candidate.
