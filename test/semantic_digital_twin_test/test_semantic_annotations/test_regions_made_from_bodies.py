"""
Building the region a region-rooted annotation takes out of a body that was measured.

A reconstruction gives every object a body, but some annotations are rooted on a region
instead: an aperture is a hole rather than a thing. Deriving the region from the body
bridges the two, and it belongs to every region-rooted annotation rather than to the one
that happened to need it first.
