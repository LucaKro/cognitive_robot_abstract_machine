"""
A database-independent snapshot of a modelled world, for comparing a run against it.

A hand-modelled world holds far more than the mesh export of it does: which body a class
was put on, which parts were mounted into which whole, and through which field. Comparing
a run against exported labels alone throws that away, so the ground truth is read out of
the world itself and written in the same shape the run writes its own graph in.

The two graphs agree on how a relation is named -- what it means and the field realizing
it -- because both read it from the ontology rather than spelling it out.
