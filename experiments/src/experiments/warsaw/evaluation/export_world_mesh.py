"""
Write a world as a scene a modelling tool can open, one named object per body.

RViz shows a world but is a poor place to pick it apart. A GLB opens in Blender with
every body its own object in the outliner: click one and its name is in front of you,
hide it and see what is behind, and no ROS is involved at all.

Each node is named ``<body> [<Class>]``, so a click says both what the run called the
object and what it decided the object is. Only the exported scene is named that way; the
world itself is read afresh and never written back.

The same command writes the run's world and the modelled world it is compared against,
so the two can be opened side by side.
