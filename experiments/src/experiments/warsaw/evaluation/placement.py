"""
Both worlds as objects that can be paired by where they are.

Class and size are all two worlds in unrelated frames agree on, and in a kitchen they
are nearly evidence-free: every drawer of a run of drawers is the same class and the
same size, so which one was paired with which is close to arbitrary. Where an object
sits is what tells them apart, and it becomes available the moment landmarks relate the
two frames.

Bringing them together is one job with two halves. A run's bodies are cut back out of
the scene they were segmented from and moved by the fitted transform, which also carries
the scale, so what comes out is in the modelled world's frame and in metres however the
scan was scaled. The modelled world's objects are already there.
