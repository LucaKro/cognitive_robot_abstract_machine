done, and being written to a run's files. Each is a handful of lines, and a module apiece
made the two look like separate concerns rather than the small shared ones they are.

    Something a step writes into a run's directory, or reads out of a model's reply.

    Every step reads what the step before it wrote, so each field name is written in one
    module and read in another. Mirroring each file in a dataclass writes those names
    once: the reader and the writer are the same declaration, and a field that moves
    moves for both. What reads and writes it is krrood's serializer, working from the
    fields themselves, so the mapping is not spelled out anywhere.

    A record reaches this class from two sides. A file the pipeline wrote carries the name
    of the class that wrote it, so reading it back needs nothing but the file. A model's
    reply carries no such name -- it was written by something that has never heard of these
    classes -- so the class it is read on is taken to be the class it is.
