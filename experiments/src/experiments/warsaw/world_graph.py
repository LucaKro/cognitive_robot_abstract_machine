A world drawn as one interactive graph of its entities and the relations between them.

The page shows bodies and regions joined by their connections, and each semantic
annotation joined to whatever its fields hold, so a drawer can be followed to the cabinet
holding it and to the body it is rooted in. It can be zoomed, searched by name or class,
and cut down to the annotations alone.
