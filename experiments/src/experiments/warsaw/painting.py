"""
Painting a world's bodies so that one can be told from another.

A world published in the colours it was scanned or modelled in is one colour: a grey
room in which nothing can be picked out. Painting it by what each body *is*, or simply
by which body it is, is what makes a viewer worth opening.

Only the world held in memory is painted. Worlds reach a viewer read afresh from a
database or built afresh from a file, and are never written back, so nothing here
reaches what was recorded.
