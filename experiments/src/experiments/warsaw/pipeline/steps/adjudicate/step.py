"""
Answer what the measurements and the ontology leave open about a scene's overlaps.

Two things stand between a labelled mesh and a world of bodies, and neither follows from
the geometry:

- **who owns a face two labels both claim**, without which the mesh cannot be split, since
  a face belongs to exactly one body;
- **which whole a part belongs to**, where a door meets more than one cabinet.

Both are asked as few times as they are actually open. Ownership is asked once per set of
claimants rather than once per pair of them, never where the ontology already settled every
relation inside the set, and once per *pattern* of classes rather than once per occurrence
-- a door and a window sharing a pane is one question however many glazed doors the room
has. Membership is asked only where a part meets more than one candidate.

This decides nothing itself.
