"""
Ask whether the ontology, rather than the room, is what is wrong -- and mend it.

When objects of two classes are measured to share a surface and no field of either
admits the other as a structural part, one of two things is true: those objects want a
class of their own, or the class they were read as is missing a mixin. This puts the
second to a model, one class pair at a time, and carries out what it accepts.

An amendment is not a pipeline output. It edits the class in the ontology's own source
and regenerates the ORM, so it holds for every room, every world already in the database
and everything built on the ontology afterwards -- which is why the model is asked about
the class rather than about the objects, and why applying it is a separate setting.

Which mixin would grant a relation is never guessed: it is found by composing the class
with each mixin and asking the same question a mount asks. The model decides only
whether the class should have it.
