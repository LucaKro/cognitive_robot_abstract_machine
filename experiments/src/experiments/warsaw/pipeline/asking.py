"""
Putting a question to a model, and putting an unusable answer back to it.

Four of the pipeline's steps ask a model something: which class a label means, whose a
contested face is, which whole a part belongs to, what each body is. They differ in what
is said and how the answer is read, and agree on everything around that -- keeping the
reply as it came back, reading a kept one instead of asking again, checking the answer is
usable, and asking once more with what was wrong when it is not.

An answer naming a class that is not in the taxonomy is worth nothing, and saying so is
cheaper than either dropping the question or letting a person correct it by hand.
