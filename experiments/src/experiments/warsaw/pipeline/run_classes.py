"""
Keep the classes a run generates inside that run.

A scene needs classes the taxonomy does not have -- a ``Ceiling``, a ``KitchenIsland``.
Written into the ontology's own package, as they were, they are a tracked file that
every run leaves modified, one careless ``git add`` away from becoming part of the
shared ontology, and importable by the next run's taxonomy export.

They belong to the run that proposed them, so they are written into its directory. The
run's directory is then put at the *front* of the annotations package's search path,
which makes its file the one imported under the name the ORM refers to them by, ahead of
the package's own empty one. The ORM generator finds them by walking that path, so it
maps them without being told anything.

This has to be done before anything imports the ORM or the classes, which is why it is a
call at the top of a step rather than something a step can opt into later.
