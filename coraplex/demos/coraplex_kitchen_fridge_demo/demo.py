"""
A PR2 opens the fridge of the small kitchen, takes a milk out of it, closes the fridge
again and puts the milk down on the kitchen island.

The plan is assembled from the core action designators rather than delegating to
:class:`~coraplex.robot_plans.actions.composite.transporting.TransportAction`, which
recognizes drawers only and would leave the fridge door shut.

The world is built from specifications: the kitchen comes from a URDF, the robot from a
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.api.RobotSpecification`, and the shelf and the milk from
body and annotation specifications placed relative to the fridge.

..note:: This demonstration is written for a simulated run. Running it with
    :attr:`~coraplex.datastructures.enums.ExecutionType.REAL` fetches the world from a
    controller, and the world fetcher does not run
    :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.reasoning.world_reasoner.WorldReasoner` over what it
    receives, so the fridge annotation the scene is placed against would be missing.
